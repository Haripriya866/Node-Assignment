## Tech Stack
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript, REST APIs

## Setup Instructions
1) Create Project Directory: mkdir node_assignment
2) Navigate to that folder: cd node_assignment
3) Initialize Node.js Project: npm init -y
4) Install Dependencies: npm install express dotenv axios mongodb
5) Install TypeScript as a development dependency: npm install --save-dev typescript
6) Set up .env File: Create a .env file to store sensitive information such as database connection strings and port number. Never commit this file to version control.
7) Create Initial Files: Create models/ directory and db.ts, server.ts files in the src folder, outside of src folder create tsconfig.json file Also, create a .gitignore file and add node_modules/ and .env to it.

## push the code to Git using the following commands
* git init
* git remote add origin https://github.com/Haripriya866/Node-Assignment.git
* git add -A
* git commit -m "node assignment"
* git branch -M main
* git push -u origin main

## Deployment
Choose a Platform: Select a deployment platform like render

Configure Environment Variables: Set the necessary environment variables (database connection string, port number) on the deployment platform.


Deploy the Application: Follow the platform's instructions for deploying a Node.js application. This typically involves pushing your code to a Git repository and configuring the platform to run your application.
 
Test the Deployment: After deployment, test the application thoroughly to ensure that all features are working correctly.

Test the APIs using postman tool
